# Profile

I am an Electronics Engineering graduate with a passion for science and mathematics, focusing intensively on cultivating cross-domain expertise and learning to do what I love the most: understanding how things work.

I have a track record of over two years working with startups, research labs and industry in leadership and freelance capacities to develop products in healthcare, environment, automotive & finance with my contributions across Full Stack Development, IoT, Embedded Systems & AI.

I freelance part-time on platforms like Upwork, Freelancer & Contra undertaking several projects in software development, embedded electronics and robotics as an independent contractor.

I am also currently exploring the cryptospace as a Web3 Developer at <a href="https://github.com/globe-and-citizen">Globe & Citizen</a> where we're building the CNC (Crypto Native Corporation) Portal, an app that creates a mechanism to financially acknowledge the micro contributions of Open Source collaborators along with tools that promote effective governance.
