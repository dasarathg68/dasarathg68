## Profile

I am a passionate engineering graduate focusing intensively on cultivating cross-domain expertise and learning to do what I love the most: understanding how things work.

I have a track record of over three years working with startups, research labs and industry in leadership and freelance capacities to develop products in healthcare, environment, governance & finance with my contributions across Full Stack Development, Web3, IoT, Embedded Systems & AI.

I undertake projects in software development, embedded electronics and robotics as an independent contractor, manage teams across the globe and have successfully completed over 10 projects.

I am also currently freelancing as a Web3 Developer at <a href="https://github.com/globe-and-citizen">Globe & Citizen</a> where we're building the CNC (Crypto Native Corporation) Portal, an app that creates a mechanism to financially acknowledge the micro contributions of Open Source collaborators along with tools that promote effective governance. 

Further, I am a core contributor at <a href="https://github.com/ctrlsa">@ctrlsa</a>, an Ethereum Foundation sponsored project, where I'm contributing to the R&D and building MiniApps that simplify crypto transactions within the scope of the Telegram Messenger.
